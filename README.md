# DLForNLP

In this repository, I will share my insights and implementations related to deep learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Table Of Contents
- [NLP BASICS](#nlp-basics)
- [NLP ADVANCED](#nlp-advanced)

<br>

## NLP BASICS
This folder contains implementations of the following:
1. **Word2Vec**: Implementing the Skip Gram and CBOW models for learning word embeddings using PyTorch.
2. **RNN Basics**: Implementations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including GRU, LSTM, and BiLSTM.

<br>

## NLP ADVANCED
This folder includes implementations of intermediate to advanced NLP models:
1. **Image Captioning**: A model that generates captions for images using a sequence model (pre-trained Inception_v3 as encoder and LSTM as decoder).
2. **Seq2Seq Machine Translation (Without Attention)**: Basic sequence-to-sequence model for machine translation.
3. **Seq2Seq Machine Translation (With Attention)**: Enhanced sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism for machine translation.
4. **Transformer from Scratch**: Implementing the transformer networks for NLP tasks.
5. **Seq2Seq Machine Translation Using Transformer**: Advanced sequence-to-sequence model using transformers for machine translation.
6. **Vision Language Models**: Coming soon.
